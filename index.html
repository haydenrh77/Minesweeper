  Microsoft Minesweeper
</p>
<p>
  In Minesweeper, mines are scattered throughout the board. To start playing you click on a square. If a number appears, that indicates the number of mines in the surrounding squares. Either directly adjacent or diagonally adjacent. If a square is blank, there are no mines within the spaces surrounding it.
  <br>
  If you guess where a mine is, right click the square to place a flag on it marking it as a mine. This helps you remember where mines might be. To beat the game you must uncover all spaces except for the spaces with mines.
